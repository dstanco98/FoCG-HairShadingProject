# FoCG-HairShadingProject
Project of Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, Sapienza University of Rome, 1st semester a.y. 2022/2023

Hair Shading: 1 person in C++
- add support for shading hairs following [pbrt](https://www.pbrt.org/hair.pdf)
- if doing this project, contact the professor for test scenes
- you cannot use the pbrt code directly, neither link to it nor cut and paste into your code; you need to carefully refactor this into Yocto and provide the proper abstractions
